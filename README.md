# COMP2110 Task Manager 2024

## Widget #1: Task Summary: Thi Thach Thao Tran 47764554

The widget shows statistics from the currently displayed tasks:
- Numbers of tasks in each category (ToDo, Doing, Done). 
- Numbers of high priority tasks: the larger the number, the higher the priority is. Here we consider the priority score larger than 7 is important. 
- Numbers of due today: The deadline is today and it is not in category Done. ("Due Today" is to let the user know how many more tasks that user need to do today. Hence, if the task is in category Done, it will not be counted towards Due Today tasks).
It is automatically updates when tasks are added, removed or changed.

## Overall Design: The whole team 
The Theme Colors for Designing:
- #F7F6F3 (Darker Gray Color used for Widget backgrounds)
- #072754 (Navy blue)
- #c4509b (Neon Pink)

In the design, we use gradient Neon Pink - Blue navy to create an sci-fi, clean and futuristic outlook. Instead of solid border line, we use colors and shadow to differentiate blocks. To make the design more modern, we also adÄ‘ in rounder border (adjust using border radius). 

We select a dark theme for widgets so that user can focus on the main part of the website in bright color (task manager).
